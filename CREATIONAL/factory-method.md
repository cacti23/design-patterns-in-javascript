## Structure 🏗️

1. The product declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses

2. Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface

3. The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It’s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface. You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.

> Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.

4. Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.

> Note that the factory method doesn’t have to create new instances all the time. It can also return existing objects from a cache, an object pool, or another source.

## Typescript Example 💻

```typescript
/**
 * The Creator class declares the factory method that is supposed to return an
 * object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide the
 * implementation of this method.
 */
abstract class Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of the
   * factory method.
   */
  public abstract factoryMethod(): Product;

  /**
   * Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is
   * not creating products. Usually, it contains some core business logic that
   * relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method. Subclasses can
   * indirectly change that business logic by overriding the factory method
   * and returning a different type of product from it.
   */
  public someOperation(): string {
    // Call the factory method to create a Product object.
    const product = this.factoryMethod();
    // Now, use the product.
    return `Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with ${product.operation()}`;
  }
}

/**
 * Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change the
 * resulting product's type.
 */
class ConcreteCreator1 extends Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product
   * type, even though the concrete product is actually returned from the
   * method. This way the Creator can stay independent of concrete product
   * classes.
   */
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct1();
  }
}

class ConcreteCreator2 extends Creator {
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct2();
  }
}

/**
 * The Product interface declares the operations that all concrete products must
 * implement.
 */
interface Product {
  operation(): string;
}

/**
 * Concrete Products provide various implementations of the Product interface.
 */
class ConcreteProduct1 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct1}";
  }
}

class ConcreteProduct2 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct2}";
  }
}

/**
 * The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator, albeit through
 * its base interface. As long as the client keeps working with the creator via
 * the base interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass.
 */
function clientCode(creator: Creator) {
  // ...
  console.log(
    "Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works."
  );
  console.log(creator.someOperation());
  // ...
}

/**
 * The Application picks a creator's type depending on the configuration or
 * environment.
 */
console.log("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.");
clientCode(new ConcreteCreator1());
console.log("");

console.log("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.");
clientCode(new ConcreteCreator2());
```
