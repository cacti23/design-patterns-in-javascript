## Single Responsibility Principle üîç

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a software development principle that states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility.

To illustrate the SRP, consider the following code example in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving ${this.make} ${this.model} ${this.year}");
  }

  displayDetails() {
    console.log("Make: ${this.make}, Model: ${this.model}, Year: ${this.year}");
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class has two responsibilities: driving and displaying details. This violates the SRP since the class should only have one responsibility. We can refactor this class to adhere to the SRP principle by separating the responsibilities into separate classes:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving ${this.make} ${this.model} ${this.year}");
  }
}

class CarDetails {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  displayDetails() {
    console.log("Make: ${this.make}, Model: ${this.model}, Year: ${this.year}");
  }
}
```

By separating the responsibilities, we can now modify or extend each class independently without affecting the other.

## God Object üôè

A God Object is an anti-pattern in software development where a single object or class is responsible for too many things. It violates the SRP principle and makes the codebase difficult to maintain, modify, or extend.

For example, consider a `Customer` class that has multiple responsibilities, such as processing orders, sending emails, and handling payments. This violates the SRP principle and makes the `Customer` class a God Object.

## Separation of Concerns üë•

Separation of Concerns is a software development principle that states that each module or component should have a single responsibility. It is closely related to the SRP principle and helps to improve modularity, maintainability, and extensibility in code.

For example, consider a web application that has a frontend and a backend. By separating the concerns of each component, we can write clean and efficient code that is easy to maintain and modify.

| Frontend                                               | Backend                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsible for the user interface and user experience | Responsible for server-side logic and data storage      |
| Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript                         | Uses server-side languages such as Java, PHP, or Python |
| Communicates with the backend through API calls        | Provides APIs for the frontend to interact with         |

By separating the concerns of each component, we can write modular and reusable code that is easy to test, debug, and deploy.
