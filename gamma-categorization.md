Gamma categorization, named after Erich Gamma, is a classification of design patterns into three main categories: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns

1.  Creational Patterns 🏗️: These patterns deal with object creation, addressing complexities that may arise from the basic form of object creation. Examples include Factory Method, Singleton, and Builder.

2.  Structural Patterns 🌉: These patterns are concerned with the structure of classes and relationships between entities. They focus on class inheritance and composition. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, and Composite.

3.  Behavioral Patterns 🔄: These patterns identify common communication patterns between objects and optimize them. They are about the assignment of responsibilities between objects and encapsulating behavior. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command.

In summary, Creational Patterns deal with object instantiation 🏗️, Structural Patterns focus on the blueprint of classes and their relationships 🌉, and Behavioral Patterns address the communication and interaction among objects 🔄.
